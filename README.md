# Sayhello
## 
Capturing audio (.wav) from target using a link


### How it works?

After the user grants microphone permissions, a website redirect button of your choice is released to distract the target while small audio files (about 4 seconds in wav format) are sent to the attacker.
It uses [Recorderjs], plugin for recording/exporting the output of Web Audio API nodes (https://github.com/mattdiamond/Recorderjs)

### Remark:

The original author has deleted their github account for some reason.
This code is now maintained by me.

### Features:

Port Forwarding using Serveo or Ngrok
